# Advent of Code 2023

This is my set of solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023, written in Python 3 without type annotations.
All solutions expect the input from standard input and print the solution to standard output.
Most solutions use just The Python Standard Library, with exception of [part 2 of day 21](21/part2.py), where I leveraged [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for least squares [polynomial fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression), and [part2 of day 24](24/part2.py), where I leveraged [sympy](https://www.sympy.org) for an algebraic solution to system of equations.
